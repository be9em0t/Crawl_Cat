in our documentation crawler we need to set up documentation extraction for Unity ShaderGrpah Nodes:
https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.shadergraph@17.4/manual/Node-Library.html

To that end, we need to provide in #file:config_unity_shadergraph.yaml a correct pydantic model for Crawl4ai to consume .

In the yaml file, In the pydantic_model key I have stored a tree graph of the structure. Please work out a correct Pydantic model that reflects these requrements: 
1. follows the provided structure in pydantic_model key. Replace the structure with the correct pydantic model
2. reflects the Unity ShaderGrpah Nodes pages at https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.shadergraph@17.4/manual/Node-Library.html 
3. is similar to the models in #file:config_openai_fees.yaml 
4. works with multi-page source: the provided URL contains links to sub-pages, that contain either another sub-categories or shadergraph nodes. 
5. each branch should end in one or more nodes!

I love the you now set edge cases to fail clearly, keep it that way.

So prompt in this case is the place where we bring together guidance wtih some extra instructions and html, declared as placeholders in it? If this is going to work with the yaml its fine.

1. lets refactor the build_schema_prompt
2. we only pass --source <id> that will get necessary data from sources.yaml, lets not add more attibutts, it  is already pretty complicated. Dont touch other attributes for now, once we get the prompts running we'll clean them up.
3. I've added both guidance and prompt to the #file:sources.yaml , under id:openai_fees_v1

So thats the task - dont go into any extra work, lets only make the guidance and prompt work at this stage


--
Produce a JSON Schema (draft-like) describing the structured information present on the page.
Return only the JSON Schema object as JSON (no commentary). Include required fields and types.
Prefer simple types (string, number, boolean, array, object). Add a top-level `examples` key with one example instance.
--
Produce a compact JSON Schema (as a single JSON object) that describes the structured data present on the page. Requirements:

Include top-level title and description keys summarizing the purpose of the object.
For each property under properties include:
- type (string, integer, number, boolean, array, object)
- description: one concise human-readable sentence describing the field and when it appears
- examples: a short array with 1 example value (for objects/arrays include a representative instance)
If the field is an object, provide its own properties, required, and description keys and include examples for nested fields.
If the field is an array, specify items with a type and an examples array showing an example item.
Set required at the top-level and at nested object levels for fields that are always present. Use optional fields only when truly optional.
Keep the schema compact (avoid overly permissive additionalProperties: true unless necessary).
Add a top-level examples array containing one representative complete instance of the object (matching the schema).
Prefer concrete, narrow types (e.g., 'integer' for counts, 'number' for prices, 'string' for textual labels, 'boolean' for flags).

Important: this page contains pricing and model names. Do NOT omit any pricing or model-related information. Specifically ensure the schema includes a top-level `models` array (or equivalent) describing each model found on the page. For each model entry include at minimum the following fields when present on the page:
- `model_name` (string)
- `input_cost` (number or string, e.g. 0.03)
- `output_cost` (number or string)
- `units` (string, e.g. "USD per 1K tokens")
- `notes` (string, optional: additional tier/availability notes)

Also extract other fee entries (realtime, image generation, responses API, assistants, subscription tiers, priority processing), and include them under explicit properties (e.g. `realtime`, `image_generation`, `responses`, `assistants`, `subscription`) with structured subfields for costs and units.

Glossary requirement: produce a `glossary` object that lists every field name you put in the schema, with a one-line description and one example for each. The glossary must not omit fields that appear on the page.

Return only the raw JSON object (no explanation, no markdown/code fences).

Do NOT wrap the JSON in markdown or code fences (e.g. ```json). Return the raw JSON object only, with no surrounding text or formatting.
--
Prompt and settings to extract model pricing and glossary from pricing pages. Require models array with model_name, input_cost, output_cost, units, notes; require glossary listing all fields

Guidance: `Return a strict JSON array that represents the ShaderGraph structure`.
  The top-level value MUST be a JSON array of topic objects. Each topic object must have:
    - "topic": string
    - "categories": an array of category objects
  Each category object must have:
    - "category": string
    - "nodes": an array of node name strings

Rules:
  - If a topic has zero categories, represent it as a single category with the topic name.
    Example: {"topic": "Channel", "categories": [{"category": "Channel", "nodes": ["Combine Channels", "Split Channels"]}]}
  - Do NOT include any descriptions, explanations, or extra text outside the JSON array.
  - Only return valid JSON (no Markdown, no commentary). 

Example top-level shape:
  [
    {
      "topic": "Artistic",
      "categories": [
        {"category": "Adjustment", "nodes": ["Channel Mixer", "Contrast"]},
        {"category": "Blend", "nodes": ["Blend Node A", "Blend Node B"]}
      ]
    },
    {
      "topic": "Channel",
      "categories": [{"category": "Channel", "nodes": ["Combine Channels", "Split Channels"]}]
    }
  ]

Make the JSON precise: include all topics, categories and node names found on the page in the structure above.
--
You are given the HTML content of a web page (URL: https://openai.com/api/pricing/).
Analyze the content and propose a compact JSON Schema that describes the data a user would want to extract from this page.

Guidance: Produce a compact JSON Schema (as a single JSON object) that describes the structured data present on the page. Return only the raw JSON object (no explanation, no markdown or fences). Include a top-level `examples` array with one example instance. Ensure the schema contains a `models` array describing model entries when present on the page. Do NOT wrap the JSON in markdown or code fences. Return the raw JSON object only.

"""Pydantic model tuned for OpenAI pricing page extraction.

This file defines structured types for model pricing entries found on
https://openai.com/api/pricing/. It is written to be compatible with
Pydantic v1 (the project's requirements pin pydantic>=1.10,<3).

Features:
- Nested, explicit types for model pricing entries (input/cached/output/training)
- Validators that parse raw cost strings like "$0.03 / 1K tokens" into numeric
  value and units for easier downstream use.
- Helper `get_json_schema()` that returns a JSON schema dict whether Pydantic
  v1 or v2 is installed (handles both `schema()`/`schema_json()` and
  `model_json_schema()`). This avoids warnings where code expects
  `model_json_schema()`.

I know that you were able to extract the right pydantic model on a previuos run, but I suspect you used the url: as analysis source. The JSON output of the explore workflow is unstructured and is not useful in generating a pydantic model. I admit I have midirected you here.

Vla:
Ok, here i start to panic. When working with llm workflow we used pydantic model. I know people are on owe with the thing, but it was pretty dramatic failiure in this case.

Generation of the model seems complete black art (and I'm not going to read 200 pages of documentation to fix this)
When we used the Crawl4Ai function to generate the model the results were extremely hit and miss
Different llm models (gpt4, gpt5-mini, oss, phi 3 and 4) generated vastly different results
the method that worked best was to ask Copilot look at the source pages and generate pydantic model
So, going forward:

I would like to adjust formatting of explore workflow output to facilitate better understanding of the pydantic model that will represent it.
look into ways of generating pydantic models that will correctly reflect the explore workflow
summarise for me the basics of the pydantic model, so I can have some oversight over it
Does this sound ok, and if yes lets work on point 1.

Grok:
Agreed—your concerns with Pydantic model generation via LLM are valid; it's often inconsistent and requires manual tuning. Relying on Copilot for source-page analysis is a pragmatic workaround, and we'll build on that.

Plan Confirmation
Adjust Explore Output: We'll modify the explore workflow to output a structured JSON format that highlights the data structure (e.g., categories, nodes, descriptions) from the crawled content. This will make it easier to visualize and derive a Pydantic model, rather than raw Markdown.
Generate Pydantic Models: Once we have clearer output, we can refine model generation—starting with Copilot-assisted creation based on the structured data, then testing for consistency.
Pydantic Basics Summary: I'll provide a quick overview below for your oversight.
Let's start with point 1: Adjusting the explore output.

Proposed Change for Explore Output
Current: Saves combined Markdown or a list of {"url": "...", "content": "raw markdown"}.
New: Extract key elements (e.g., node names, descriptions) from the content and output a JSON array of objects, e.g.:
This mirrors your NodeLibrary structure, making Pydantic modeling straightforward.
I'll update the code to add basic extraction logic (e.g., regex or simple parsing) for node data in workflow_explore. If the content structure varies, we can refine it.

Ready to implement the output adjustment? Let me know if you want to tweak the extraction logic!

Vla:
Almost ready to implement. Here are my considerations:

I have chosen explore workflow to save markdown because markdown is easier to check by a hooman for missed elemens. You are right, verifying structure with markdown is much harder than in JSON.
i dont want to lose the work we did on mardown, as I feel that it has its merits. To that end, lets keep the code for markdown export, add (or improve existing) code for JSON export, and export as multiple formats if more than one format is specified in out_format: key.
I've put a placeholder in id: shadergraph_content_explore for multiple format exports,
lets execute on providing export as json and/or markdown as requested.

Grok:
Excellent! The multiple format export is working perfectly—141 pages crawled, with both Markdown and JSON saved. The JSON output provides a structured view of the raw content, making it much easier to analyze the data patterns for Pydantic modeling.

Quick Summary of Outputs
Markdown: Human-readable, great for spotting missing elements or verifying completeness.
JSON: Machine-readable list of {"url": "...", "content": "raw markdown"} per page—ideal for parsing node names, descriptions, and hierarchies programmatically.
This addresses point 1: The JSON now facilitates better understanding of the underlying structure (e.g., categories like "Artistic", "Math", with nested nodes and descriptions).

Next Steps for Point 2: Generating Pydantic Models
With the structured data in hand, we can reliably create Pydantic models. Since Copilot worked well for you before, I recommend:

Feed the JSON to Copilot: Share a sample from shadergraph_content_explore.json (e.g., 5-10 entries) and ask it to generate the NodeLibrary model with nested Category and ShaderNode classes.
Manual Refinement: Use the existing model in your YAML as a starting point, then adjust based on the data patterns.
Validation: Test the model with sample data to ensure it captures all fields (e.g., optional subcategories, descriptions).
If you'd like, I can help generate a sample Pydantic model based on the JSON structure—share a snippet from the output, and I'll propose one! Otherwise, proceed with Copilot and let me know how it goes. 🚀

Vla:
nice.
I expected the JSON to generate nested structure with node pages as child nodes to category pages, according to #fetch https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.shadergraph@17.4/manual/Node-Library.html

Grok:
Summary
I addressed your expectation for a nested JSON structure from the explore workflow output. The initial flat JSON (list of {"url": ..., "content": ...}) didn't reflect the hierarchy, but I've now created a proper nested structure.

What Was Done
Analyzed the Flat Output: The crawled data was a flat list of 141 pages, including the root Node Library page, category pages, and individual node pages.

Parsed the Hierarchy:

Extracted 9 categories from the root page (Artistic, Channel, Custom Render Texture, Input, Math, Procedural, UI, Utility, UV).
For each category, parsed subcategories (e.g., Adjustment, Blend under Artistic) and their individual nodes.
Built Nested Structure: Created shadergraph_hierarchy.json with the following hierarchy:

Generated Pydantic Models: Created shadergraph_models.py with validated Pydantic classes:

NodeLibrary → Category → Subcategory → Node
Models include proper typing and validation.
Key Improvements
Nested JSON: Now reflects the parent-child relationships (categories → subcategories → nodes) as expected from the Unity docs structure.
Pydantic Validation: Ensures data integrity and provides a solid foundation for the DOM workflow.
Reusable Models: The generated models can be imported and used for structured data handling in your crawler.
The nested JSON provides the structured data you needed to facilitate accurate Pydantic model generation, avoiding the "hit and miss" issues from LLM-based approaches. You can now proceed to implement the DOM workflow with JsonCssExtractionStrategy using these validated schemas.

Vla:
This looks amazing.

The JSON structure looks perfect. I havent tested how well the pydantic model will work as we still dont have the dom workflow implemented.
I would like to encapsulate your process of analyzing the structure and generating pydantic model and hyerarchycal JSON in additional workflow. Corrrect me if I'm wrong:
explore workflow: define the base url, filters, crawl depth etc. and verify the result by the hooman. Output: markdown and JSON
NEW pydantic workflow: based on the explore configuration generate correct pydantic model, generate structured JSON and let the hooman verify the result. Output: pydantic model and JSON for user verification. This stage obviously includes heavy LLM involvement in generation of the model and verification of the result.
dom workflow: based on config file and pydantic model crawl and extract correct information. Output: well-structured JSON. (note: this workflow probably will output the same JSON as pydantic workflow, but without the overhead of generating and testing a pydantic model)

New prompt Vla:
Working on our #file:crawl-cat2.py documentation extraction app we've got to the point where we can nicely crawl the correct pages from url:, and give the hooman a markdown and non-structured JSON to verify nothing is missed. This is our explore workflow.

Now we need to expand this further to be able to extract hyerarcihcally structrured JSON ready for AI consumption as local documentation.

On a previous run we had this conversation with Grok on the subject and after a couple of iterations a perfectly structured JSON was achieved. But then we were not able to modularize this process i a way that we keeo #file:crawl-cat2.py clear and modular, and adjust extraction proces to different sites using the config.yaml files.

The conversation is here #file:Converstion Vla-Grok.md 
Please analyze it and try to implement a workflow "pydantic" that will use the settings of "explore" workflow and its output (markdown and JSON files) to come up with correct pydantic model of the url:, then use that model to extract a structured JSON from the url:

We have some version of pydantic model already, "shadergraph_content_pydantic". Please dont feel constrained by it and replace it with a working version.

My suggestion is to:
- use intelligent processing using the provided in config.json llm: to create a pydantic model suitable for extraction of structured JSON. Currently, we are able to extract correct but unstructured  pages via explore workflow, based on DOM elements.
- create a promt tailored to the specific url: and based on output of explore workflow, that will allow the llm to intelligently analyze and create a correct pydantic model, that it should test and iterate until extraction results match the site structure 
- rely on files resulting from explore workflow ( out_file: "shadergraph_content" means they will be named shadergraph_content.md and shadergraph_content.json)
- rely also on the url:, it is our ground truth
- once you have a working prompt store it in the config.yaml for future use
- save the pydantic model as "shadergraph_content_model.py"
- save the structured JSON outpup as "shadergraph_content_pydantic.json"
