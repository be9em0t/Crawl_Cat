As I;m still working out the best approach, lets scaffold this:
main.py - gui entry point to the individual scrapers that might use different strategies and target different docuentation sites
openAI-cat.py - test scraper that will check the currently available openAI models and their parameters 

# fetch OpenAI models and their parameters (token window, cost etc.)
# the script can be run with python openAI.py or can be invoked from the main.py GUI
# token should be imported from environment using dotenv.
