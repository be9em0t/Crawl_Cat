    description: "Extract the hierarchical structure of Unity ShaderGraph nodes, including categories, subcategories, and individual nodes with descriptions. Require graph_nodes arrays with nested categories and nodes."
    instruction: |
      From the crawled content of this page, extract Unity ShaderGraph nodes, categories, or subcategories present.
      Output a single NodeLibrary object.
      - If this page is the main Node Library page, populate graph_nodes with category objects (name only, no subcategories or nodes), and block_nodes similarly.
      - If this page is a category page (e.g., Artistic Nodes), populate graph_nodes with a single category object containing its name, and either subcategories (if the page has sections like Adjustment, Blend) with their nodes, or direct nodes if no subcategories.
      - Do not output multiple objects or empty categories. Ensure subcategories are nested under their parent category.
      - Only include data actually present on the page.

      You are provided with the output from an explore workflow: a JSON file containing a list of pages with their URLs and raw markdown content, and a markdown file with combined content.

      The site is the Unity ShaderGraph Node Library documentation. The structure is hierarchical:

      - Root: NodeLibrary with graph_nodes (both lists of Category). Don't include the block_nodes.

      - Node: name, url (optional), description (optional)

      Analyze the provided data to understand the exact hierarchy and fields present.

      Generate appropriate Pydantic BaseModel classes in Python that accurately represent this structure.

      Include proper field types (str, List, Optional), descriptions using Field, and relationships.

      Ensure the models can be used for schema-based extraction.
