"Return a single JSON object (the JSON Schema). Do not include any explanation.\n\n"
"Additionally, provide a `glossary` object: a list of field entries where each entry contains `name`, `description` (one-line), and `examples` (an array with one example).\n"
"If you cannot provide all descriptions or examples, return empty strings or empty arrays but keep the fields.\n"
"Return a single JSON object that may contain both the schema and the glossary under keys `schema` and `glossary`, or return the schema alone - code will attempt to detect both formats."
